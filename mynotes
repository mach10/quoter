I am trying Heroku for the first time. These are my notes to
help me remember what I did.

heroku login #to login, obvs
heroku logout #to logout, obvs
foreman start #to run app locally
Ctl-C to stop

I have my branch no-db running on Heroku via this command:
git push heroku no-db:master

Then I used:
heroku ps:scale web=1 to start
heroku ps:scale web=0 to stop
